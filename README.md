# A-semidiscretization-of-the-isothermal-Euler-equations

The aim is to model the gas transport through a pipeline network with compressor stations as controllable elements. We first introduce a mathematical model based on the isothermal Euler equations and rewrite this in Riemann invariants. Then we use a central finite differences approach to discretize the space derivative and solve the resulting system with a Crank-Nicolson Method.
